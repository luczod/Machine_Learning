### Neuron

- Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in 1899
- image of neuron

### Backpropagation

- Percetron: Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt and his whole idea was to create something that can actually learn and adjust itself.
- When $\hat{y} \neq y$, use the cost function and CHANGE A WEIGHT from input values. Restart
- Y hat is equal to Y cost functional zero. Usually you won't get cost function equal to zero. Stop
- All the rows share the weights.
- One epoch is when we go through a whole data set and we train our neural network on all of these rows

### Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Overall global minimum rather than the local minimum
- Adjust the weights after every single row, rather than doing everything together(Gradient Descent)
- Ir's much lighter algotihm
- Stochastic method (random)
